# Plong-Game
Plong is a basic arcade game that is often regarded as a variant or homage to the classic game Pong, one of the earliest video games. It typically involves a minimalist design where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen, trying to prevent it from passing by their paddle.

Here is the video to showcase the final outcome of this amazing project building it from scratch.
